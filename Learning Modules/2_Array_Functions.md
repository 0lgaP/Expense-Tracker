## JS Array Functions

[Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) are a form of Object and are stored in the Heap, with their reference or identifier stored in the stack. 
The three main array methods you will use in junior react are: &nbsp;
 ``` map() , filter() , reduce()``` 

Particularly important in this project are:

* The [map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

* The [filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)  method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
